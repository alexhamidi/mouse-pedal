Uses your mouse as a piano sustain pedal. Left click down holds sustain, releasing it lets go.

Sends MIDI CC64 (sustain) over a virtual MIDI port, so it works with any DAW or piano software.

## setup

Make sure the IAC Driver is turned on in Audio MIDI Setup (Spotlight/Raycast > Audio MIDI Setup > Window > Show MIDI Studio > IAC Driver > "Device is online").

Then install dependencies and run ```python main.py```
